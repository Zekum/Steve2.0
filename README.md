How to use
</h2>

In order to use Steve you must use the sidebar version of the Bing AI, unfortunately I haven't figured out why the normal version does not work when trying to use Steve.
  - Choose Either [Steve Mini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZekusV/Steve2.0/main/SteveMini.stv), [Steve Mini Base64](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZekusV/Steve2.0/main/SteveMini64.stv) (Recommened) or [Steve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZekusV/Steve2.0/main/SteveLoader.stv) (Not recommened)
  - Copy the raw text
  - Send to Bing AI chatbox
  - That's it!
